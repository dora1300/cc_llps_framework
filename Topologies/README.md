This directory contains the .itp and .top topology files for each of the protein models studied in this paper. The .top files are set up for the slab simulations, and so specify the number of proteins for each protein model to achieve approximately 450 coils in a simulation. The .top files can be changed for any other type of simulation by changing the number of molecules in the [ molecules ] directive.
