# Example design file for building a CC protein
# Description of the file format and how to use this is provided in the proteinBuilding_README.md
# Design files MUST be .CSV. There are 6 columns that hold information about each segment. The columns are:
# Segment type , start index of segment (1-index) , end index of segment (1-index) , start index of first 'a' heptad position, type of multimer, special ID for multimer
# See the below design file for making a 3-coil-2-linker protein with dimer-forming coils, each coil with a unique ID to enforce the maximally specific interaction regime,,,,
